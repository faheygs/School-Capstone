# School-Capstone
This is the capstone I did for my Software Development BS degree

I have this project hosted at URL http://shannanigans.herokuapp.com/
To login as an admin user you may use credentials:
      Email: shannanigans@email.com
      Password: admin
      
Or you can login as a user with the following credentials:
      Email: user@email.com
      Passwor: test
      
I have the admin account setup to add/remove/update products
and the user acocunt along with all additional users created can
add products to a shopping cart and reach a checkout point that
will create an order history. The purchase page you can enter
any information as there is no validation or requirements yet.
